I'll provide you with a step-by-step guide on what you need to do to build your meal planner and grocery list application based on the project structure you've shared. Here's a linear process to follow:

### 1. Set up the project

1. Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript:

```plaintext
npx create-next-app@latest meal-planner-and-grocery-list --typescript
```


2. Navigate to the project directory:

```plaintext
cd meal-planner-and-grocery-list
```


3. Install additional dependencies:

```plaintext
npm install @shadcn/ui tailwindcss appwrite
```


4. Set up Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui following their official documentation.


### 2. Configure Appwrite

1. Create an Appwrite account and set up a new project.
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add Appwrite configuration:

```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=your_appwrite_endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```


3. Create the `src/lib/appwrite.ts` file to initialize Appwrite client.


### 3. Set up the project structure

1. Create the folder structure as outlined in your provided structure.
2. Set up the basic `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` files in the `src/app` directory.


### 4. Implement authentication

1. Create signup and login pages in `src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx` and `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`.
2. Implement the `useAuth` hook in `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` for managing authentication state.


### 5. Create the dashboard

1. Implement the dashboard page in `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`.
2. Add navigation to other sections of the app.


### 6. Implement ingredient management

1. Create the ingredients list page in `src/app/ingredients/page.tsx`.
2. Implement the ingredient detail page in `src/app/ingredients/[id]/page.tsx`.
3. Create `IngredientList` and `IngredientForm` components in `src/components/ingredients/`.


### 7. Implement meal management

1. Create the meals list page in `src/app/meals/page.tsx`.
2. Implement the meal detail page in `src/app/meals/[id]/page.tsx`.
3. Create `MealList` and `MealForm` components in `src/components/meals/`.


### 8. Implement shopping list functionality

1. Create the shopping lists overview page in `src/app/shopping-lists/page.tsx`.
2. Implement the shopping list detail page in `src/app/shopping-lists/[id]/page.tsx`.
3. Create the shopping mode page in `src/app/shopping-lists/[id]/shop/page.tsx`.
4. Implement `ShoppingListOverview` and `ShoppingListItems` components in `src/components/shopping-lists/`.
5. Create the `useShoppingList` hook in `src/hooks/useShoppingList.ts`.


### 9. Implement user profile and settings

1. Create the user profile page in `src/app/profile/page.tsx`.
2. Implement account deletion functionality in `src/app/profile/delete/page.tsx`.
3. Create the settings page in `src/app/settings/page.tsx`.


### 10. Implement categories management

1. Create the categories management page in `src/app/categories/page.tsx`.


### 11. Implement shopping list history

1. Create the shopping list history page in `src/app/history/shopping-lists/page.tsx`.


### 12. Add error handling and not found pages

1. Implement error handling in `src/app/error.tsx`.
2. Create a not found page in `src/app/not-found.tsx`.


### 13. Implement responsive design

1. Use Tailwind CSS classes to make all components responsive.
2. Test the application on various device sizes.


### 14. Add security measures

1. Implement input validation on all forms.
2. Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks.
3. Ensure secure data storage in Appwrite.


### 15. Write documentation

1. Update the `README.md` file with project setup instructions and feature explanations.
2. Document the data flow and client-server interactions.


### 16. Implement testing

1. Write unit tests for critical components and functions.
2. Implement integration tests for key features like shopping list generation and user management.


### 17. Final review and deployment

1. Conduct a final review of all features and functionality.
2. Deploy the application to a hosting platform of your choice (e.g., Vercel).
